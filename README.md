# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
This project utilizes VBA to analyze various green energy stock options. The analysis demonstrates total daily volume and return for 12 green energy stock options in the years of 2017 and 2018.  

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help inform Steve's parents about stock options related to green energy by analyzing performance by total daily volume and return for two years (2017 and 2018). The analysis included an input box to prompt the user to indicate which to analyze (2017 or 2018). The analysis also included a message box to indicate the run time for each analysis to assess the refactored analysis.

## Results
The results of this analysis provide helpful information for Steve's parents as they consider opportunities to invest in green energy stocks. Key findings include the following: 
- Overall, green energy stocks performed better in 2017 vs 2018 when analyzing percent return.
- ENPH and RUN stocks were the only two stocks in 2018 with positive return.
- ENPH and RUN stocks also had the highest daily volume in 2018.

The tables below summarize total daily volume and return for each of the 12 stocks in 2017 and 2018.

## Refactored Analysis
The refactored analysis resulted in shorter run times for both 2017 and 2018 analyses:
- The refactored run time for 2018 was 0.1367188 seconds (compared to original run time of 0.8203125).
- The refactored run time for 2017 was 0.2617188 seconds (compared to original run time of 0.8359375).

## Summary

What are some advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general?
- Advantage: Refactoring code results in shorter run times which is particularly helpful for large datasets.
- Advantage: Refactoring can help clean-up and organize code, making it easier to understand and duplicate for scalability.
- Disadvantage: Refactoring requires additional time and resources. 
- Disadvantage: Refactoring can result in additional errors and need for debugging, even when we had a code that worked originally.
